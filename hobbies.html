<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Aditya Abhishek, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student from India, currently in my 4th semester of BTech. My journey into the tech world began with curiosity, but it quickly turned into a deep passion for programming, web development, and AI.</p>

<p>In my 2nd year of college, I started learning full-stack web development, driven by the goal of building impactful projects. Whether it's for internships, placements, or personal growth, I love creating websites and applications that solve real-world problems. Along the way, I've developed a strong foundation in frontend and backend technologies, constantly improving my skills to stay updated with industry trends.</p>

<p>Beyond web development, I am highly interested in AI and Generative AI, exploring its applications and potential to shape the future. My enthusiasm for competitive programming also pushes me to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
With every project, I aim to learn, innovate, and growâ€”because for me, technology is not just about writing code, but about creating solutions that make a difference.</p></p>
